### Understanding Git Branch

A **Git branch** is essentially a pointer to a specific commit in your Git repository. Branching allows you to isolate your work into different contexts, such as adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or experimenting with new code, without affecting the main codebase (often the `main` or `master` branch).

When you create a new branch, you create a new pointer that allows you to work on that code separately. The **default branch** in a Git repository is typically `main` or `master`. 

Let's explore various Git commands related to branches.

### Git Branch Commands

1. **`git branch`**  
   Lists all the branches in your repository. The currently active branch is highlighted with an asterisk `*`.

   ```sh
   git branch
   ```
   **Example Output:**
   ```
   * main
     feature-branch
     bugfix-branch
   ```

2. **`git branch <new branch>`**  
   Creates a new branch with the specified name. This branch will be created from the commit at the current HEAD (the latest commit of the currently checked-out branch).

   ```sh
   git branch feature-branch
   ```
   - This creates a branch named `feature-branch`.

3. **`git checkout <branch>`**  
   Switches to the specified branch, updating your working directory to match the branch's state.

   ```sh
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```
   - This command switches the working directory to the `feature-branch`.

4. **`git checkout -b <new branch name>`**  
   Creates a new branch and immediately switches to it.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b new-feature-branch
   ```
   - This creates and switches to a branch named `new-feature-branch`.

5. **`git branch -d <branch name>`**  
   Deletes the specified branch. This will only work if the branch has been fully merged into your current branch or any other.

   ```sh
   git branch -d feature-branch
   ```
   - This deletes the `feature-branch` if it has been merged.

6. **`git branch -D <branch name>`**  
   Forcibly deletes the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes.

   ```sh
   git branch -D experimental-branch
   ```
   - This forcefully deletes the `experimental-branch` regardless of its state.

7. **`git tag <tag name>`**  
   Creates a lightweight tag at the current commit, which can be used to mark a specific point in the repository's history.

   ```sh
   git tag v1.0
   ```
   - This creates a tag named `v1.0` at the current commit.

### Summary

- `git branch` lists branches.
- `git branch <new branch>` creates a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch>` switches to an existing branch.
- `git checkout -b <new branch name>` creates a new branch and switches to it.
- `git branch -d <branch name>` deletes a branch that is merged.
- `git branch -D <branch name>` forcefully deletes a branch.
- `git tag <tag name>` creates a tag at the current commit.
