# How to update README.md file and commit to local repository

To update the `README.md` file and commit the changes to your local repository named `WForWomen`, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to the Local Repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd D:\Git\WForWomen
   ```

2. **Update the `README.md` File:**
   - Open the `README.md` file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad,Notepad ++, Visual Studio Code,Atom etc.).
   - Make the necessary changes to the file.
   - Save the changes.

3. **Check the Status of the Repository:**
   - Run the following command to see the status of your repository and verify the changes:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This command will show the modified files (including `README.md`) that have not been staged for commit.

4. **Stage the Updated `README.md` File:**
   - To stage the updated file, run:

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```
   This command adds the changes in `README.md` to the staging area.

5. **Commit the Changes to the Local Repository:**
   - Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update README.md with new changes"
   ```
   This command creates a new commit with your changes and message.

### Result

Your `README.md` file is now updated, staged, and committed to your local repository. The changes will remain in your local repository until you push them to the remote repository on GitHub.
