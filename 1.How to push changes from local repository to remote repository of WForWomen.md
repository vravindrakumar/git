# How to push changes from local repository to remote repository of "WForWomen"

To push changes from your local repository to the remote repository (`WForWomen`) on GitHub for the first time, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to the Local Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd D:\Git\WForWomen
   ```

2. **Check Remote Repository URL:**
   - Verify that your local repository is linked to the correct remote repository by running:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   If no remote repository is configured or the output is empty, you need to add the remote URL.

3. **Add Remote Repository (If Not Added):**
   - Add the remote repository URL by running:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/cloudtechnet/WForWomen.git
   ```
   This command sets the remote repository named `origin` to point to your GitHub repository URL.

4. **Push Changes to Remote Repository:**
   - To push your changes for the first time, use the following command:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - The `-u` option sets the upstream (default) branch to `origin/main` so that future `git push` commands can be simplified.
   - If your repository's default branch is not `main`, replace `main` with the correct branch name.

5. **Authenticate (If Prompted):**
   - If this is your first push, you might be prompted to enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password. Enter your credentials to authenticate.

### Result

Your changes are now pushed from the local repository to the remote repository (`WForWomen`) on GitHub. Subsequent pushes can be done using a simple `git push` command.
