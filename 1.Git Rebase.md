# Git Rebase

`git rebase` is a Git command used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Unlike `git merge`, which creates a new commit to combine branches, `git rebase` moves or reapplies commits from one branch on top of another.

### Key Benefits of `git rebase`:
- **Cleaner history**: Instead of multiple merge commits, it creates a linear history.
- **Improved collaboration**: Makes it easier to see the project history by eliminating redundant merge commits.

### How `git rebase` works:

Consider the following scenario:
1. You have two branches: `main` and `feature`.
2. The `feature` branch was created from `main`, and you made some commits on `feature`.
3. Meanwhile, the `main` branch has new commits as well.

Without `rebase`, if you use `merge`, it will create a merge commit. But with `rebase`, you can apply the changes from `feature` on top of the latest `main` branch commits, effectively "rebasing" them.

### Example:

1. **Initial state**:
   ```
   main: A---B---C
                   \
   feature:          D---E
   ```
   Here, `A`, `B`, `C` are commits on the `main` branch, and `D`, `E` are commits on the `feature` branch.

2. **Run rebase**:
   ```
   git checkout feature
   git rebase main
   ```

   What this does is it takes the `D`, `E` commits from the `feature` branch and re-applies them on top of the latest commit in `main` (`C` in this case).

3. **Rebased state**:
   ```
   main:    A---B---C
                      \
   feature:            D'---E'
   ```

   Now, `feature` is updated, and the history is linear. Notice that `D` and `E` have become `D'` and `E'` because they are new commits on top of `C`.

4. **Push after rebase**:
   After rebasing, if your branch is tracked remotely, you will need to force push because the commit history has changed.
   ```
   git push --force
   ```

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Avoid rebasing shared branches**: Rebase rewrites commit history, so itâ€™s best to avoid using it on branches that others are working on.
- **Conflicts can happen**: Just like in merges, conflicts may occur during a rebase if there are conflicting changes.

In short, `git rebase` helps you keep a clean and readable commit history by replaying your changes onto the latest base of another branch.
