# Git branch protection rules

**Git branch protection rules** are a set of configurations used to safeguard important branches (like `main` or `master`) from unintended changes or deletions. These rules are essential in collaborative environments to enforce quality control and protect key branches from direct modifications or other harmful actions.

### Why Use Branch Protection Rules?
- Prevent accidental force pushes or deletions of critical branches.
- Ensure that code is reviewed and tested before it is merged into the main branch.
- Enforce best practices like requiring pull requests and successful test runs.

### Common Git Branch Protection Rules

1. **Require pull request reviews before merging**:
   - Prevents direct commits to a protected branch.
   - Enforces that any code must be merged via a pull request (PR) and reviewed by one or more team members before merging.

   **Example**: You set a rule that at least two developers must review and approve a PR before it can be merged into the `main` branch.

2. **Require status checks to pass before merging**:
   - Ensures that automated tests (CI/CD pipelines) and other checks (e.g., linting, code quality) must pass before a pull request can be merged.

   **Example**: If you have a CI pipeline that runs unit tests, code coverage checks, and security scans, the PR will be blocked until all checks are successful.

3. **Require signed commits**:
   - Enforces that all commits pushed to a protected branch must be signed with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys, verifying the authenticity of the committer.

   **Example**: You can set up the branch to only accept commits that have been cryptographically signed by developers, ensuring that the commits come from trusted sources.

4. **Require linear history**:
   - This ensures a linear commit history by prohibiting merge commits. It enforces rebasing to avoid complex and cluttered commit histories.

   **Example**: After enabling this rule, youâ€™ll need to use `git rebase` instead of `git merge`, keeping the commit history clean and straightforward.

5. **Prevent force pushes**:
   - Disallows force pushing (`git push --force`) to protected branches. Force pushes can overwrite history and remove important commits.

   **Example**: If someone tries to force push to the `main` branch, Git will reject the action, preventing accidental loss of code.

6. **Prevent deletions**:
   - Prevents the deletion of protected branches, ensuring critical branches like `main` or `develop` are never accidentally removed.

   **Example**: If you try to delete the `main` branch, Git will deny the operation, preserving the branch.

7. **Require branch to be up to date before merging**:
   - Enforces that the branch being merged is up to date with the base branch (e.g., `main`), which prevents merging out-of-date code. You will need to merge or rebase to bring the branch in sync with the base branch.

   **Example**: A developer submits a PR for merging but another developer has already merged new changes to the `main` branch. Git will require the feature branch to be updated with the latest `main` changes before the PR can be merged.

8. **Require conversation resolution before merging**:
   - Requires that all conversations (comments, discussions) on the pull request must be resolved before the branch can be merged.

   **Example**: If a reviewer has left comments on specific parts of the code in a PR, the author will need to address and resolve those comments before merging is allowed.

9. **Locking the branch**:
   - Only specific users or teams are allowed to push or merge to the protected branch.

   **Example**: A project lead or senior developer might be the only one with permission to merge into the `main` branch.

10. **Code owners approval**:
    - Enforces approval from designated code owners before merging. Code owners are responsible for certain parts of the codebase, and their approval ensures that domain experts review any changes to critical files.

    **Example**: If changes are made to specific critical files (e.g., core application logic or security-sensitive code), the respective code owner(s) must approve the changes before merging.

### How to Set Up Branch Protection Rules (Example for GitHub)
In GitHub, you can apply these protection rules directly from the repository settings.

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Branches**.
4. Under the "Branch protection rules" section, click **Add rule**.
5. Specify the branch name (e.g., `main`).
6. Configure the desired rules such as requiring pull request reviews, preventing force pushes, etc.
7. Click **Create** to enforce the rules.

Other platforms like GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos have similar settings for applying branch protection rules.

### Key Points:
- **Prevents bad practices**: By requiring code reviews and successful tests, you prevent bad code from entering critical branches.
- **Encourages collaboration**: Teams can safely collaborate while ensuring that important branches remain stable.
- **Helps maintain a clean history**: Linear history and commit signing keep the codebase manageable.

Branch protection rules are essential for maintaining the integrity of critical branches in a Git workflow, especially in large teams or production environments.
